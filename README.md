## Problem Statement
Over the course of the years, many students buy and use a multitude of items and services. We believe that recycling some of these items and services through the Penn community would help reduce waste to the environment while connecting students to cheaper options for their educational needs. Since buyers and sellers are from the same Penn community, this app would lower costs for students looking to buy something (e.g. used textbooks, workbooks, clothes, furniture, etc…).

Furthermore, there are a variety of platforms and websites that students usually list their items on, oftentimes leading to meetups with strangers. By using our app, we can limit the transaction population to the Penn community and reduce the risk of “shady” meetups.
